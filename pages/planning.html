			<h1>Expert Financial Services</h1>
			<p>The financial planning process includes identifying your financial goals, gathering the relevant information, developing a written plan, putting it into action, and reviewing it periodically. At Sponenburgh, we understand that different businesses and individuals have different financial goals. Hence, we customize our services to suit your future goals.</p>
			<h2>Financial Planning Process</h2>
			<h3>Initial Discussion â€“ Determining Your Needs</h3>
			<p>The very first step of a sound financial planning process includes accessing your current financial situation with regard to assets and liabilities, income and expenses, debts and so on. Preparation of a list, which has all your financial details, gives you a solid foundation to move in the direction of achieving your short-term, mid-term and long-term financial goals.</p>
			<h3>Developing a Financial Plan</h3>
			<p>Based on your goals, we devise a financial plan, which includes our suggestions regarding the course of action you should take to achieve your goals. We also come up with an alternative course of actions at this stage of planning and eventually zero-in on a particular plan, which suits you the best.</p>
			<h3>Putting the Plan in Action</h3>
			<p>At this stage, we implement your plans and focus on achieving short-term goals for you as they come first in the priority list. As time passes, the focus shifts to mid-term to long-term goals.</p>
			<h3>Evaluating the Plan</h3>
			<p>Strategic financial planning is a dynamic process that does not end at implementing a plan. For a plan to fully succeed a financial plan needs regular assessment and modifications, as and when necessary.</p>
